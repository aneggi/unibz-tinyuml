08/03/2022 - Class counter

Tried to add listener for classes, tried to find a Class named CLASS and then tried to find the place where buttons on the GUI are pressed
Found inside the ApplicationState code the listener already exist (generic one with DiagramEditor class)
    Try to find type of element, there is a list of class DiagramElement "line 365", 
    Found ElementType Class that have the type
    Try to find another way and add type of element to handler in the ApplicationState but inside DiagramElement there is no property easy to understand, 
        found DiagramElement but is 
    Try to looking for "ElementType.class" in all files and fond SequenceDiagramEditor extend DiagramEditor
    Find in MODEL UMLCLASS class is called in different files, found also a directory STRUCTURE so draw and logical strcture seems separat
    Find "StructureDiagram extend DiagramEditor" that have a MAP with all objects include CLASS and in the key there is the type 
    Go to looking for COMPONENT class, i can get component selected when built...
    Found from analysys of getUMLModel the content and found UMLMODEL+UMLMODELIMPL that cotains all. Want to add methodods that count classes
    DIAGRAMS can have multiple UMLDIAGRAM, but there is a LINKEDLIST inside with childre and this part is quite complicated 
    because is not linear and each kind of component implement different property and methods (this is a big difference with Javascript)
